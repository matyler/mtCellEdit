.SH NAME

.P
cedfuzzmap \- map between fuzzed strings in mteleana data

.SH SYNOPSIS

.P
\fBcedfuzzmap\fR [ \fBOPTION\fR ]... DICTIONARY [[ \fBOPTION\fR ]... [ INPUT ]]...

.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Take an input file, and try to replace strings so they conform to the dictionary.
Fuzzing is done at the word level, so "foo bar" is assumed to be the same as
"bar foo".  If an exact match is not found, the original is left in place and
the most similar matches are sent to stdout.

.P
Before comparisons, strings are cleaned up by removing non\-alpha characters,
with everything changed to lower case.
