General election results came from various sources on the web:

The 1945 election had several seats that had more than one MP (e.g. Oxford University).  These are represented as 2 seats on the map and in the results.

Boundary Information

The SVG maps are a very loose approximation to the boundaries published by:

http://boundarycommissionforengland.independent.gov.uk/
http://www.boundarycommission.org.uk/
http://bcomm-wales.gov.uk/
http://www.bcomm-scotland.independent.gov.uk/

My goal in creating the SVG files was primarily visual simplicity rather than strict geographical accuracy.  I find this simplicity more aesthetically pleasing than a pedantically accurate map.
