<H3>A.1.1 Keyboard Shortcuts</H3>

<P>
Several of the menu options have keyboard shortcuts which are labelled next to the option.  In addition to these facilities, there are further shortcuts that you may find useful.  This first table lists shortcuts that are available when the focus in on the sheet (such as when you start mtCellEdit).
</P>

<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="4">

</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
This table lists the keyboard shortcuts you can use when you are editing the cell text in the cell entry box:
</P>

<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="4">
<TR>
<TD>Escape</TD>
<TD>Cancel current operation</TD>
</TR>
<TR>

</TR>
</TABLE>

<A NAME="SEC21"></A>
<H3>A.2.1 CED Files</H3>

<P>
A CED file is in fact a ZIP archive file.  You can use whatever file extension you like. I chose the ZIP archive format because it can be opened using any operating system, thus allowing anyone to open the collection of sheets easily and independently of the mtCellEdit program.  The ZIP archive contains files in the following form:
</P>

<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="4">
<TR>
<TD><B>Internal Filename</B></TD>
<TD><B>Description</B></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>filename/sheet/*</TD>
<TD>Each sheet in the book is stored here as a TSV/Ledger file, with its name being in place of *.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>filename/values/*</TD>
<TD>This is an optional section used when saving the values within the CED file. The purpose of saving cell values is: (*) It is useful for archiving purposes as the data can be read by any spreadsheet program because no formulas are saved as they are replaced by the numerical values. (*) Complex sheets with convoluted cell relationships do not require numerous recalculations between sessions to get correct values (mtCellEdit uses a very simple top-down bottom-up recalculation algorithm that can be tricked when using several forward/backward references in sheets).</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>filename/graph/*</TD>
<TD>This is where the text for each graph is stored.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>filename/prefs/book.txt</TD>
<TD>This file contains book, sheet, and cell preferences.  By keeping this data separate from the sheet data it makes it much easier to transfer the sheet data to other spreadsheet programs.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
In all cases 'filename' is the name of the original file saved, so this would be 'test' if you saved 'test.zip'.  On loading, any other file is ignored, but is stored in memory so when the book is saved again these files will be retained in the new CED/ZIP file (with the same time and date stamps).
</P>

<A NAME="SEC22"></A>
<H3>A.2.2 TSV Files</H3>

<P>
A TSV file (Tab Separated Value) is my preferred file format for sheets as it can be read by any good spreadsheet program.  I prefer it over CSV because its simpler.  The CSV format has the major flaw that commas can be used in a cell thus complicating the encoding of each cell text (i.e. the inefficient " quotation system). TSV files are simpler as the tab character is never used in a cell, and therefore its much quicker to parse this file format than any other encoding.
</P>

<A NAME="SEC23"></A>
<H3>A.2.3 Ledger Files</H3>

<P>
Ledger files are designed for the very rare occasion when you have a very large but sparse sheet, such as 10,000 cells of content within a 1,000,000,000 x 1,000,000,000 sheet.  Saving this to a TSV or CSV file would be grossly inefficient because of the duplication of empty cells.  The down side of using ledger files is that the format cannot be read by other spreadsheet programs.
</P>

<A NAME="SEC24"></A>
<H3>A.2.4 CSV Files</H3>

<P>
Despite being widely used, the CSV file format has no official specification, and sadly this means that different programs create slightly different CSV files.  As a result of this some files may not load properly into mtCellEdit (or other spreadsheet programs). However, mtCellEdit should load all RFC-4180 compliant files as long as they don't contain newlines inside a field.
</P>

<H2>A.3 Functions</H2>

<P>
A function returns a number.  Valid function syntax is:
</P>
<P>
<B>function_name( [ARG]... )</B>
</P>
<P>
Arguments are separated by a <B>,</B> or <B>;</B> character.
</P>
<P>
A <B>NUM</B> is a decimal number, a function, or a <B>CELLREF</B>.  A <B>STRING</B> is a collection of characters with " quotes, e.g. "Hello".
</P>
<P>
A <B>CELLREF</B> takes the r1c1 notation, e.g.
</P>

<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="4">
<TR>
<TD>r1c1</TD>
<TD>Absolute reference.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>r[-1]c[-1]</TD>
<TD>Relative reference.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>r_c_</TD>
<TD>_ is a shorthand for the maximum row/column number.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
A <B>RANGE</B> takes the form:
</P>
<P>
<B>CELLREF:CELLREF</B>
</P>
<P>
Cells and ranges in other sheets can be referenced by using:
</P>
<P>
<B>'sheet_name'r1c1</B>
</P>
<P>
Here is a complete list of functions mtCellEdit understands when placed after an = character in the cell text:

<H2>A.6 Limitations</H2>

<P>
As with all software, mtCellEdit has some limitations.  In some cases any attempt to overcome these limitations would invalidate the purpose and philosophy of the project.  Therefore I am documenting these limitations in order to explain the policy decisions I have taken.  However, mtCellEdit is free software so if anyone disagrees then they are free to fork the code and implement their own ideas.
</P>

<A NAME="SEC61"></A>
<H3>A.6.1 Localization</H3>

<P>
mtCellEdit is entirely written in English, with all language and numerical notation being geared towards that locale.  There are many different languages and numerical systems that could be supported by a spreadsheet program, but to do so it would complicate the program, and the data files that the program creates.
</P>
<P>
For example, one of the rules I insist on with mtCellEdit is that whatever text the user enters into a cell this must be exactly what gets recorded in the saved file.  I have a particular dislike of programs that subvert user input via optimizations, or corrections (such as removing spaces in formulas or capitalization of certain letters).
</P>
<P>
This causes a problem when saving data to a TSV file and moving the data between locales that use a different decimal point system.  For example if I have a TSV file with 1.23 in it, my English locale will interpret that as a decimal number.  However in a French locale this would not be recognised as a number and so would be treated as a text string.  Naturally the reverse would also be true with 1,23 being a decimal number in the French locale but not the English locale.
</P>
<P>
In other words we have a problem regarding data portability and non-deterministic program behaviour.  From version 1.4.0 of mtCellEdit I avoid this problem by enforcing a C locale when the program starts, so all data is interpreted using the same standards whatever locale the operating system happens to be using. When not using the GUI and using libmtcelledit directly the calling program will need to set the locale to 'C' otherwise there will be undefined results.
</P>
<P>
Another example of localization regards right to left rendering of cells, and the use of exotic fonts and various font substitutions.  Even if I had the time and expertise to implement such features, this would dramatically bloat the program, and complicate many parts of the program structure.
</P>
<P>
Because of these issues, I have decided to keep mtCellEdit a solely English locale project.  I do not have the time or inclination to change this.
</P>

<A NAME="SEC62"></A>
<H3>A.6.2 Spreadsheet File Formats</H3>

<P>
I have deliberately chosen to not support mainstream file formats for other spreadsheet programs as they are reliant on complex binary or XML files.  I have seen these various formats come and go over the years as the programs that use them become popular, and then fade into obscurity.  In the beginning the 'industry standard' program was Visicalc, then Lotus 1-2-3, and most recently Excel.  Each program has also adopted various major revisions to its file format over its lifetime, which makes data portability even more of a problem.
</P>
<P>
Due to the policy decisions of the creators, those 'industry standard' programs are continuing to use data formats that will not stand the test of time, and are a bad choice as a data archive format.  Therefore I refuse to support them, and this is why I prefer to use simple text based formats instead. Somebody using the Awk program on a Unix system in 1980 could easily manipulate a TSV file, as they can today, and as they will be able to do for decades to come. In other words this file type is built to stand the test of time, and is therefore the best choice as an archive format.
</P>
<P>
In short, mtCellEdit has never, and will never support binary or XML based data files. 
</P>

<A NAME="SEC63"></A>
<H3>A.6.3 Dates</H3>

<P>
The year in a date is only valid from 0 to 5879609.
</P>
<P>
All years are interpreted literally, so an abbreviated two digit year is considered different to a four digit year.  For example 25/10/12 is not the same as 25/10/2012.  This strictness avoids ambiguity and problems like the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
If you encounter a datafile which contains a two digit year that you wish to convert to a four digit year you would do the following:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Select the relevant cells you want to change.
<LI>Select the menu option "Edit - Fix 2-digit Years"
</UL>

<P>
By default this assumes the years are to be changed to some time in the last 50 years or the coming 49 years.  If you want to change the start year to something else you must change the Program Preference "date.2digit_year_start".
</P>

<A NAME="SEC64"></A>
<H3>A.6.4 Numbers</H3>

<P>
Each cell contains a number which is stored internally as a double precision floating point number.  Typically this means it is accurate to 15 significant decimal digits.
</P>
<P>
When displaying this number as a binary or hexadecimal number the accuracy is about 52 bits.
</P>

<A NAME="SEC7"></A>
<H2>A.7 Graph Language</H2>

<P>
Graphs are defined in a block of text using my own data language called utree (which is part of libmtKit).  Here is a simple example which illustrates how to use instructions that contain various attribute values, with various useful comments:
</P>

<PRE>
  /*
  	This is a comment - it can contain any text.
  */
  
  
  { instruction_name
  	attribute="value"
  	another_attribute="value"
  	"This contains spaces"="Backslashes and quotations must be backslashed first: \\ and \" - easy isn't it!"
  
  	sheet="Sheet Name"
  /*
  	Normally attribute values are only used in the instruction that defines them.
  	However, the 'sheet' attribute value is special as it is used by all subsequent
  	instructions until it is re-defined.
  */
  
  }
  
  { another_instruction
  
  /*
  	Comments can appear anywhere.
  	This instruction contains no attributes, so the default values are used.
  	See below for a complete list of default attribute values.
  */
  
  }
</PRE>

<P>
All attribute values are considered as double precision floating point numbers unless otherwise stated below. You can use spreadsheet notation and functions such as "2.0 + 2.1", "2011-10-9", "rgb(1,2,3)", "0xFFAA11" or even use cell references (use this wisely as the sheet attribute must be set properly).
</P>

<A NAME="SEC71"></A>
<H3>A.7.1 Conceptual Outline</H3>

<P>
The general sequence of a graph should follow this pattern:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Define the page, graph, and plot areas.
<LI>Define the X and Y axis.
<LI>Plot the axis text and markings. (OPTIONAL)
<LI>Plot any gridlines that appear beneath the graphs. (OPTIONAL)
<LI>Plot the shapes and lines using data from a sheet. (OPTIONAL)
</UL>

<P>
Any number of graphs and gridlines can be used, each with their own X and Y axis settings.
</P>

<A NAME="SEC72"></A>
<H3>A.7.2 Page Layout</H3>

<P>
The page is initially defined as a physical width and height, with the origin of (0,0) being at the top left corner.  Each unit is 1/72 of an inch.  This page contains a 'graph' rectangle which itself contains a 'plot' rectangle which is used to do all of the final plotting on using the logical X and Y axis settings as prescribed.
</P>
<P>
The 'graph' area contains top, bottom, left and right axis titles, with additional text labels and axis markings (all optional).
</P>

<A NAME="SEC73"></A>
<H3>A.7.3 Graph Instructions and Attributes</H3>

<P>
Here is a table with a list of instructions and attributes that they use.  In addition, all drawing or plotting instructions (i.e. page, graph, plot, plot_*) will be affected by:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>antialias
<LI>arrowhead
<LI>fill_color
<LI>line_color
<LI>line_size
<LI>text_color

<H2>A.9 File Handling</H2>

<P>
When editing a file in mtCellEdit the titlebar describes the file IO permission via a code:
</P>

<TABLE BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="4">
<TR>
<TD>{}</TD>
<TD>Book has no filename yet.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>{RW}</TD>
<TD>File is Read/Write (i.e. any other program can write to it).</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>{RWL}</TD>
<TD>File is Read/Write and Locked against other programs writing to it via a temporary read only file permission on disk.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>{RO}</TD>
<TD>File is Read Only and cannot be saved using this filename.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
At all times you can edit the book in memory but you can only save using the current filename if a W is present in the title bar.

<H3>A.9.1 File Locks (RWL &amp; RO)</H3>

<P>
By default mtCellEdit loads data from a file and edits this in memory until the user saves the data.  This is pefectly reasonable under most circumstances, but occasionally this is unsafe such as when an absent minded user accidentally opens the same file in two mtCellEdit instances.  If the user has unsaved data in instance 1, and then loads the same file into instance 2, these changes will not appear in instance 2.  If the user was to make changes in instance 2 and save those changes this could create real confusion and potentially lose data.
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid such problems between mtCellEdit instances, or even other programs editing files, you can switch on a locking mechanism which switches off the write permissions on the file while it is being edited.  Then other programs are stopped from making changes until mtCellEdit finishes editing it and the original file permissions are restored.
</P>
<P>
In the program preferences, filter for 'lock' and you should find:
</P>

<PRE>
  file_lock_load
  file_lock_save
</PRE>

<P>
Switch both to RWL and then every time you load and save a file a Re-Write Lock is enabled.  Then any other program, including multiple mtCellEdit instances, cannot modify the file while it is still being edited by the original mtCellEdit instance.
</P>
<P>
You can also force all files to be Read-Only after loading or saving if that suits your needs.
</P>
<P>
If you have the {RWL} setting on, it may fail under a specific circumstance and be {RW}.  This happens when a user has permission to write to the file but is not able to change the write permission to get a lock.  If this is because another user owns the file, or you are not in the correct file group, you can simply save the file to get {RWL} locking enabled which changes the ownership of the file.
</P>

<H3>A.9.2 Saving (Temporary File)</H3>

<P>
In mtCellEdit and mtCedCLI, when saving a file to disk a temporary file is used to initially write the data to.  This is to protect against power failure, OS failure, hardware failure, etc causing the original file data to be lost before the new data is saved.  Once the temporary file has been successfuly saved it is renamed to the designated filename to complete the operation.
