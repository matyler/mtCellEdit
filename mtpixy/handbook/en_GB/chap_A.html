<H1>Appendix A - Miscellaneous</H1>

<A NAME="SEC1"></A>
<H2>A.1 Limitations</H2>

<P>
As with all software, mtPixy has some limitations.  In some cases any attempt to overcome these limitations would invalidate the purpose and philosophy of the project.  Therefore I am documenting these limitations in order to explain the policy decisions I have taken.  However, mtPixy is free software so if anyone disagrees then they are free to fork the code and implement their own ideas.
</P>
<P>
I regard mtPixy as feature complete so I do not plan to add any new features.  However I am always happy to tweak things here and there to make the tool more useful.  If you think there are some areas of the project that need improvement please contact me.
</P>

<H3>A.1.1 Localization</H3>

<P>
mtPixy is entirely written in English.  It should be possible to translate to any other language, but I do not have those skills so somebody else will have to do that work.
